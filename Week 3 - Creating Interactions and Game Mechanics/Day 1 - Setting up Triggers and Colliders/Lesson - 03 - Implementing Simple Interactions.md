# Lesson 3 - Implementing Simple Interactions

### **Objective:**
Create a simple script to control basic character movement.

### **Activities:**
* Creating a simple interaction, such as opening a door when the player enters the Trigger.
* Modifying the script to include conditions for the interaction (e.g., only open if the player has a key).
* Testing and refining the interaction to ensure it works smoothly.
