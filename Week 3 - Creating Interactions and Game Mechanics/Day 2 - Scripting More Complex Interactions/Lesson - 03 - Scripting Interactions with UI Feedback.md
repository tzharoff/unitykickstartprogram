# Lesson 3 - Scripting Interactions with UI Feedback

### **Objective:**
Provide feedback to the player through the UI when they interact with objects.

### **Activities:**
* Creating a simple UI element (e.g., a text popup) to inform the player of their actions.
* Modifying the interaction scripts to trigger UI updates when certain actions are taken (e.g., "Key Collected").
* Testing the UI feedback system to ensure it updates correctly during gameplay.
